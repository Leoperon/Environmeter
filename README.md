# Environmeter
This project is an example of iot where the hardware and  software are both used .Here we use different kind of integrated circuits in order to maximize the value of project and as well as the accuracy .Networking is  deeply used here  with the help of esp8266 module which actually is used for uploading the data to the server. The arduino is basically used here because it is user friendly as well as cost effective device and onboard programmer built in AD converter also reduces the circuit complexity. The sensors are very easy to use and have input output  linearity  makes this system more accurate and simple ,the main advantage is the IDE which basically written in c language  and consist of built in function makes the embedded programming  super easy ,Thinksspeak server is  a fanatastic platform for plotting sensor data and use of Matlab  also brings the stability in analyzing system data .
